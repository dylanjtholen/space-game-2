Currently it has very little, just a basic 3d renderer using webgl and a few models. It's very laggy right now, but I plan to fix that in the coming weeks.

If you want to try it out, just serve index.html

planned features:

-   multiplayer
-   shooting and stuff
-   maybe a race mode/time trial thing
